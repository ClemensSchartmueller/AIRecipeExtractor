**ðŸš¨ Important Disclaimer: This is an AI-Generated Project ðŸš¨**

This project was entirely generated by an AI assistant (a Large Language Model). While it aims to be functional and demonstrate capabilities with the Gemini API and UI/UX design, it comes with no guarantees of active support, maintenance, or future development from the original "author" (the AI).

The code is provided "as-is". It may contain bugs, inefficiencies, or deviate from best practices.

**Pull requests and contributions are highly welcome!** If you find this project interesting and wish to improve it, please feel free to fork it and submit your changes.

## About The Project

AI Recipe Extractor is a web application designed to simplify your cooking process. It specifically aims to help users take screenshots of recipes, for instance, from popular apps like **YAZIO**, and convert them into usable digital formats.

The application will:

1.  **Extract Recipe Text**: Utilize Google's Gemini API to analyze the uploaded recipe image and extract structured recipe data, including name, ingredients, instructions, prep time, cook time, and more.
2.  **Generate Dish Image**: Based on a description of the dish found in the recipe (or the recipe name), it uses Google's Imagen API to generate an illustrative image of the final dish.
3.  **Multiple Output Formats**: View the extracted recipe as **plain text** for easy copying or as **JSON-LD** structured specifically for straightforward import into recipe managers like [Tandoor Recipes](https://tandoor.dev/).

The goal is to make it easy for you to get recipes from images (like those from YAZIO or other sources) into a usable digital format, particularly for platforms such as Tandoor.

## Key Features

*   **Image-to-Recipe**: Upload PNG, JPG, or GIF images of recipes.
*   **AI-Powered Extraction**: Leverages Google Gemini API for intelligent text and data extraction.
*   **AI-Powered Image Generation**: Leverages Google Imagen API for creating dish visuals.
*   **Structured Data**: Outputs recipe data in schema.org/Recipe compliant JSON-LD, suitable for Tandoor.
*   **Plain Text Output**: Provides a simple, copy-paste friendly text version of the recipe.
*   **Responsive Design**: Works on various screen sizes.
*   **Drag & Drop Upload**: Easy file uploading.

## Tech Stack

*   **Frontend**: React, TypeScript
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
*   **AI Models**:
    *   Google Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17`) for recipe text extraction.
    *   Google Imagen API (`imagen-3.0-generate-002`) for dish image generation.

## Prerequisites

*   **API Key**: This application requires a Google Generative AI API key. The application code (`services/geminiService.ts`) directly uses `process.env.API_KEY` to initialize the AI client. You **must** ensure this environment variable is set in the execution context where the application runs.

### Setting the `API_KEY` Environment Variable

How you set this variable depends on your development and deployment environment. Here are common methods:

**1. Local Development (using a `.env` file - Recommended for simplicity)**

   For local development, it's common to use a `.env` file. Since this is a client-side application without a Node.js backend to directly load `.env` files using libraries like `dotenv`, this method assumes your development server or build process (if any) is configured to make these variables available under `process.env`.
   *If you are simply opening `index.html` directly in a browser, this method will not work without additional tooling.*

   a. Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project.
   b. Add your API key to this file:
      ```
      API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY"
      ```
   c. **Important**: Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidentally committing your API key to version control.
      ```
      .env
      ```
   d. You would typically need a build step or a development server that injects these values. For simple static sites served directly, this might involve manually replacing a placeholder or using a more advanced setup. *The current project structure assumes `process.env.API_KEY` will be populated by the environment it's running in.*

**2. Setting in your Terminal (for the current session)**

   You can set the environment variable directly in your terminal before running your development server or opening the application. This is temporary and only applies to the current terminal session.

   *   **Linux/macOS (bash/zsh):**
       ```bash
       export API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY"
       ```
   *   **Windows (Command Prompt):**
       ```cmd
       set API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY"
       ```
   *   **Windows (PowerShell):**
       ```powershell
       $env:API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY"
       ```
   After setting it, if you are using a development server, you might need to restart it.

**3. Hosting Platform Environment Variables**

   If you deploy this application to a hosting platform (like Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages with Actions, AWS Amplify, Firebase Hosting, etc.), these platforms provide a way to set environment variables for your build and runtime environments.
   *   Consult your hosting provider's documentation for instructions on how to set environment variables.
   *   You will typically add `API_KEY` with your actual key value through their dashboard or configuration files.

**Important Note:** The application `services/geminiService.ts` relies on `process.env.API_KEY` being available in the JavaScript environment where it executes. Ensure your chosen method makes the API key accessible in this way. If `process.env.API_KEY` is undefined, the Gemini API calls will fail.

## How to Use

1.  Ensure your `API_KEY` environment variable is set and accessible as `process.env.API_KEY` (see "Setting the `API_KEY` Environment Variable" above).
2.  Open `index.html` in your browser (preferably via a local development server that can provide the environment variable if you're using a method that requires it, or ensure your chosen method works for direct file opening).
3.  (Optional) Choose your preferred output format (Plain Text or Tandoor JSON-LD).
4.  Upload an image of a recipe using the uploader.
5.  The AI will process the image and display the extracted recipe and a generated dish image.
6.  You can then copy the text or JSON output, or download the generated dish image.
